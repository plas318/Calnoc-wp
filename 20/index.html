            <h4><em>The New CALNOC Ambulatory Measures Allow Quality to be Measured Across the Entire Care Continuum </em></h4>
            <p><strong>SAN RAMON, CA (PRWEB) March 23, 2016</strong></p>
            <div>
            <p>The Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes (CALNOC), today announced the first of its kind nursing quality indicators to measure and monitor the role of nursing in the Ambulatory setting. Previously the CALNOC measures guided improvement in the Acute Care setting. Quality leaders now have a new set of measures to drive performance and quality improvement in ambulatory clinics resulting in better and safer quality of healthcare for all.</p>
            <p>A goal of healthcare reform is to shift care from the inpatient acute care setting to outpatient ambulatory care. This shift works toward the goal to improve the overall health of the community, to prevent serious illness which would require hospital care and to provide care in the lowest cost setting. With the launch of the new Ambulatory Measures, CALNOC is meeting the need to measure safety and quality in community ambulatory settings.</p>
            <p>“We are excited to launch these new indicators for the Ambulatory care setting,” said Tony Sung, CEO of CALNOC. “I believe they will make a difference in improving the quality of Ambulatory care.” </p>
            <p>The Phase I Initial measure set includes Ambulatory Surgery Centers and Procedure Units. Phase II &amp; III measures are being developed in collaboration with the American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nurses. The new measures sets were introduced to the CALNOC Community on February 26, with a kick off web seminar.</p>

            <h4><em>New measure sets will empower ambulatory care nurses to use evidence-based information for improvement.</em></h4>
            <p><strong>SAN RAMON, CA (PRWEB) DECEMBER 16, 2015</strong></p>
            <div>
            <p>The Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes (CALNOC), the nation’s
            first nursing quality indicators database, today announced an important collaboration with the American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN). The collaboration will expand CALNOC’s national database of nursing quality indicators beyond acute care hospitals into the ambulatory care setting for the benefit of patient safety and quality.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>An estimated 1 billion ambulatory visits occur in the U.S. each year, with most care today provided outside of hospitals. However, much of the work done to date in patient safety addresses hospital care. The <a href="http://www.npsf.org/?freefromharm" target="_blank">Free from Harm</a> report recently released from the National Patient Safety Foundation advocates for more work to be done to prevent harm beyond the hospital setting. The collaboration between CALNOC and AAACN addresses this
            need and will help ambulatory care nurses to use evidence-based information across outpatient health care settings to increase patient safety and quality of care.</p>
            <p>“It is now more important than ever to pursue this work and further validate the critical role and need for registered nurses in ambulatory care settings,” said Cynthia Nowicki Hnatiuk, EdD, RN, CAE, FAAN, Chief Executive Officer of AAACN. “This new collaboration with CALNOC will provide new ways to measure and improve performance in ambulatory care.”</p>
            <p>Tony Sung, Chief Executive Officer of CALNOC, said, “This collaboration is an exciting and important step toward the goal of keeping all patients safe and improving healthcare quality. CALNOC has expertise in measures development, and AAACN is known for its strength in ambulatory care, together we can make significant progress toward safer healthcare.”</p>
            <p>The two organizations are expected to first begin measure development with a pilot testing phase. Look for the
            new measure set to be ready for wide use in the first half of 2016.</p>
            <p>About AAACN<br>
            The American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN) is the specialty nursing organization for registered nurses practicing in ambulatory care or outpatient settings. Founded in 1978, AAACN provides opportunities for over 3,000 members to advance their practice and leadership skills, provide connections with others in similar roles, and advocate for the ambulatory care nursing specialty. In fulfilling its mission to
            advance the art and science of the specialty, AAACN expands the influence of ambulatory care nurses as leaders of coordinated, cost-effective and quality patient care in the ambulatory setting.
